Sample of Assignment 1
Topic: advanced policy gradient. 

You pick a Markov decision process to be addressed and get it approved
by course instructors .
Alternatively, ask course instructors to help pick an MDP. 

Pick an advanced policy gradient method, e.g., TRPO or PPO. 
Implement the MDP and policy gradient agent in Python. 

Ready engines for environments, such as Gymnasium, are allowed, however, the agent must be
implemented from the first principles using PyTorch. 

That is, no ready setups from frameworks like stable-baselines3 are allowed. 

Also, for the first team project, no Gymnasium is allowed, i.e., an MDP must be
implemented from the first principles, e.g., using only numpy as the core.

Preferable forms of implementation: code repository or Google Colab. In both cases, the concrete problem
must be well described. In case of a code repository, an understandable readme must be present.
Instructions must be provided on how to reproduce results.


Recommended repository structure:
1. src/ - core components of the program (environments, agents etc.)
2. run/ - run files and bash scripts
3. artifacts/ - storage of statistics, e.g., .csv files, model checkpoints etc.
4. analysis/ - scripts for evaluation, e.g., interactive Python notebooks for statistics visualization
Teams must follow Python naming standards and conventions, rules of clean code and document code
thoroughly and appropriately.
No written reports are needed.
